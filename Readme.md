#  Customer Churn Prediction — Lloyds Banking Group (Forage Job Simulation)

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning, based on structured banking data. Built as part of the **Forage x Lloyds Banking Group Job Simulation**, the goal is to derive business insights from predictive modeling while maintaining model interpretability.

---

## Objective

To develop a robust and interpretable machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of customer churn, allowing stakeholders to take proactive retention measures.

---

## Technologies & Libraries

- **Languages:** Python  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, VSCode  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- **Model Used:** Random Forest Classifier  
- **XAI Methods:** SHAP (global/local feature importances), LIME (individual prediction explanations)

---

## Workflow

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Null value handling
- Feature engineering (e.g., churn ratios, interaction features)
- Label encoding and scaling
- Train-Test Split

### 2. **Model Training**
- Used `RandomForestClassifier` with cross-validation
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV (optional)

### 3. **Model Evaluation**
- Accuracy, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC
- Business analysis based on churned customer segments

### 4. **Explainable AI**
- **SHAP:** Visualized global and individual prediction impacts
- **LIME:** Explained why a specific customer was predicted to churn

---

## Results

- Achieved **strong accuracy and interpretability** with Random Forest
- SHAP and LIME enabled clear understanding of key churn drivers (e.g., active product count, credit score, tenure)
- Actionable business suggestions were proposed for high-churn segments
